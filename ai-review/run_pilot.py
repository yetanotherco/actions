"""Local pilot of the multi-model AI pull-request review pipeline.

One PR per invocation:
  seed (PR metadata, worktree at PR head, trimmed whole-function diff, tests list, threat model)
  -> size class: normal (one unit) / large / huge (review units by area, budget-guarded)
  -> PR map for split PRs (one cheap call)
  -> per unit, per mode (agentic / static-seed / static-diff), finder lanes in parallel
  -> docs lane -> deterministic grouping + one LLM merge call over the union of all modes
  -> cross-model verification once per merged finding -> local markdown report.

Costs: per-lane computed cost from token usage x OpenRouter prices of the endpoint the
request is pinned to, plus the billed cost for the whole run from the OpenRouter key usage
delta (GET /api/v1/key before/after).

Secrets: the OpenRouter key is read from the macOS Keychain inside this process, passed
only through child-process environments and request headers, never printed or written.
Everything printed or saved passes through mask().
